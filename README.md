# Customer-Segmentation-Using-K-Means-Clustering
This project implements K-Means clustering to segment customers based on their annual income and spending scores, using the [Mall Customers](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python) dataset from Kaggle. Python tools such as pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib/seaborn for visualizations are utilized to derive insights for targeted marketing strategies.

## Steps Involved in Customer Segmentation

- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Checking for Missing Values
- Data Preprocessing
  - Selecting Relevant Features
  - Normalizing Data
- Finding Optimal Number of Clusters using the Elbow Method
- Training K-Means Clustering Model
- Visualizing Customer Segments and Centroids
